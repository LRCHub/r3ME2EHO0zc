[00:00.19] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[00:04.54] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[00:18.04] 
[00:09.14] Oh, I love it when it feel like this
[00:11.29] Heart went a 7UP, soda pop fizz
[00:13.84] Love letter with a lipstick print
[00:15.52] Keep my wits by my bitch
[00:16.57] Better than, it's a hit, like
[00:18.21] Tip-toe, but woah, I slipped
[00:20.08] Cardiac arrest from a goodnight kiss
[00:22.47] Heart punching through my tits
[00:24.52] Get it, girl smooch, oh shit
[00:38.52] 
[00:26.72] Ooh, oh no, how scary
[00:29.63] I haven't felt this exposed, uh
[00:32.86] I'm barely out of the woods, yeah
[00:36.06] From the last time I was broken (Smoochie girl, uh)
[00:40.42] Just a sliver cuts me open, go smoochie
[00:59.92] 
[00:44.26] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[00:48.65] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[01:02.15] 
[00:53.22] Ooh, oh no, how scary
[00:56.06] I haven't felt this exposed, uh
[00:59.26] I'm barely out of the woods
[01:12.76] 
[01:02.24] But in the heat of the moment, I put my hand in fire
[01:11.54] In the heat of the moment, I gave you ooh eyes
[01:34.54] 
[01:19.59] Liquor store ice cream, eat it out my truck
[01:21.68] I wanna say, "I love you," but the words get stuck
[01:24.04] I love you, but I'm terrified to
[01:25.93] And the heartbreak ooze from my hazmat suit
[01:28.28] Suckin' on the Jolly Rancher, my tongue is blue
[01:30.68] Kiss him 'cause I'm touch-starved, I self-soothe
[01:32.64] Pretend I'm not a lover girl, I want you
[01:34.69] For a little smooch, there's nothing I wouldn't do
[01:59.69] 
[01:37.14] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[01:41.50] Smoochies, go smoochie girl
[01:55.00] 
[01:48.09] Ooh, oh no, how scary
[01:51.11] I haven't felt this exposed, uh
[01:54.49] I'm barely out of the woods
[02:07.99] 
[01:57.21] But in the heat of the moment, I put my hand in fire
[02:06.45] In the heat of the moment, I gave you ooh eyes
[02:29.45] 
[02:14.00] Is this too much keep a lock of your hair in a resin ring?
[02:18.19] Is this too much? I wanna take out my IUD
[02:22.65] Is this too much? I wanna read your favourite book
[02:26.79] Just wanna see your childhood bedsheets and be friends with your mom
[03:00.79] 
[02:32.55] But in the heat of the moment, I put my hand in fire
[02:41.61] In the heat of the moment, I gave you ooh eyes
